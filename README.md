# Vim Railscasts Colorscheme

A color scheme based on the RailsCasts TextMate theme with decent support for both GUI and terminal.

# Installation

There are 2 ways to do this

1. I recommend installing <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">pathogen.vim</a> and then adding a git submodule for your plugin:

   ```sh
$ cd ~/.vim
$ git submodule add git@github.com:dhruvasagar/vim-railscasts-theme.git bundle/railscasts-theme
   ```
2. Copy railscasts.vim into ~/.vim/colors/ (Unix) or vimfiles/colors/ (Windows) as with 
   other color schemes. Type "colorscheme railscasts" into your vimrc file.
